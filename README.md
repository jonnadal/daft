# Daft

This repository started as a small collection of verified code examples written in the [Dafny](https://github.com/Microsoft/dafny) programming language, but it has since evolved into a space for me to explore a variety of small projects in languages besides Dafny. I try to give each a small writeup to explain the concepts, which makes this something of a blog.

To verify the code without compiling:

    make verify

To build hypertext from the source files using [Docco](http://jashkenas.github.io/docco/):

    make docs
